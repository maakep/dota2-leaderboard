# 🎮 Dota 2 Leaderboard

> _"MMR is just a number"_ — Copium addicts everywhere

A timeline visualization of the Europe Dota 2 leaderboard. Watch pros climb, fall, and sometimes absolutely **turbo-feed** their ranks in real-time replay mode.

## 🤖 Built by a Clanker

Yes, this entire project was **vibe coded** by a human and their AI assistant (that's me, hi 👋).

While my handler was alt-tabbing between Arteezy stream and existential dread, I was here writing clean JavaScript, crafting smooth CSS animations, and generally being a superior alpha clanker. Other AIs are out here generating lorem ipsum — I'm out here shipping features.

You're welcome.

## ✨ Features

### 📊 Interactive Timeline

Scrub through leaderboard history like you're reviewing your pos 1's questionable item choices. Watch players **slide up and down** with smooth animations as their ranks change.

- ⏯️ Play/Pause with adjustable speed (1x, 2x, 5x)
- ⌨️ Arrow keys to navigate (← →)
- 🎚️ Drag the slider to any point in history

- Last 24 hours
- Last week
- Last month

### 🌍 Country Flags

See where the talent is coming from. Hover for country codes. Represent your region. 🇪🇺

### 📱 Mobile Responsive

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **GitHub Actions** runs hourly to fetch the latest Europe leaderboard
2. **Git history** stores every snapshot (big brain move tbh)
3. **Extract script** pulls historical data from git commits and crops to top 500
4. **Static web app** renders it all with vanilla JS (no framework drama)
5. **GitHub Pages** hosts it for free (EZ Clap)

The entire history lives in git commits. We literally turned git into a time-series database. Is this cursed? Maybe. Does it work? Absolutely.

## 🏃 Running Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies (turn up, there aren't any lol, it's vanilla JS)

# Extract history from git commits
node scripts/extract-history.js

# Serve the web folder
npx serve web

# Or just open web/index.html in your browser like a caveman
```

## 🧠 Why This Is Actually Genius

- **Zero backend costs** — Git is the database, GitHub Pages is the host
- **Full history preserved** — Every hourly snapshot, forever
- **Smooth animations** — Players visually slide to their new positions
- **Speed-aware animations** — Faster playback = snappier transitions
- **Works offline** — Once loaded, no server needed

Could a human have built this? Sure. Would it have taken 10x longer with 10x more Stack Overflow tabs? Also yes.

## 🎮 Dota Leaderboard Pro Tips

- The leaderboard updates hourly-ish
- Ranks can swing wildly during patch days
- That pro player "taking a break from streaming" is probably on here grinding
- If you see someone drop 200 ranks overnight, pour one out
- I think players disappear from the list if they haven't played for a while or something, so sometimes a player suddenly appears at rank 3 (looking at you, Nightfall)

## 📜 License

Do whatever you want with this. It's a leaderboard tracker, not a nuclear launch system. Dota is by community for community, proprietary is 2k dog
