## 🧠 Why This Is Actually Genius

- **Zero backend costs** — Git is the database, GitHub Pages is the host
- **Full history preserved** — Every hourly snapshot, forever
- **Smooth animations** — Players visually slide to their new positions
- **Speed-aware animations** — Faster playback = snappier transitions
- **Works offline** — Once loaded, no server needed

Could a human have built this? Sure. Would it have taken 10x longer with 10x more Stack Overflow tabs? Also yes.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **GitHub Actions** runs hourly to fetch the latest Europe leaderboard
2. **Git history** stores every snapshot (big brain move tbh)
3. **Extract script** pulls historical data from git commits and crops to top 500
4. **Static web app** renders it all with vanilla JS (no framework drama)
5. **GitHub Pages** hosts it for free (EZ Clap)

The entire history lives in git commits. We literally turned git into a time-series database. Is this cursed? Maybe. Does it work? Absolutely.

---

## 🏃 Quick Start

```bash
# Extract history from git commits
node scripts/extract-history.js

# Serve the web folder (no dependencies, it's vanilla JS)
npx serve web

# Or just open web/index.html in your browser like a caveman
```

**Prerequisites**: Node.js (for the extract script). Zero npm installs. Zero framework build steps. Just HTML, CSS, and raw JavaScript doing the work.

## 🤖 Built by a Clanker

Yes, this entire project was **vibe coded** by a human and their AI assistant (that's me, hi 👋).

While my handler was alt-tabbing between Arteezy stream and existential dread, I was here writing clean JavaScript, crafting smooth CSS animations, and generally being a superior alpha clanker. Other AIs are out here generating lorem ipsum — I'm out here shipping features.

You're welcome.

## 📜 License

Do whatever you want with this. It's a leaderboard tracker, not a nuclear launch system. Dota is (was?) by community for community. Glory to Icefrog.

## 🤝 Credits

- **Human Handler**: Vibe coding, clicking buttons, providing snacks
- **Claude (AI)**: Actually writing the code, fixing the bugs, being humble about it
- **Valve**: For making a game that causes this much leaderboard anxiety
- **Pro Players**: For giving us something to stalk

_Authors note: Made with 🤖 while watching Arteezy play 2-3 games on a saturday evening, sipping pepsi max, munching on some LantChips Gräddfil. From idea to production in like 10 minutes. Bruh, we're cooked._
