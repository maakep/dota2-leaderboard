# Leaderboard History Data

This folder contains the generated history files for each region's leaderboard.

## Files

- `history-americas.json` - Americas region leaderboard history
- `history-europe.json` - Europe region leaderboard history
- `history-sea.json` - Southeast Asia region leaderboard history
- `history-china.json` - China region leaderboard history

## Generation

These files are auto-generated by `scripts/extract-history.js` during the build process.
They are extracted from git history of the `leaderboard/*.json` files.

**Do not edit these files manually** - they will be overwritten on each build.

The `.gitkeep` file ensures this directory exists in git before the first build.
